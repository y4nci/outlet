Consciousness, the state of being aware of and able to think about one’s existence, thoughts, and surroundings, remains one of the most profound subjects in philosophy and science. This presentation tries to look at the concept of consciousness from biological and artificial intelligence (AI) perspectives, highlighting key philosophical debates and their ethical implications.

## Defining Consciousness  
From a philosophical point of view, consciousness encompasses subjective experiences, often called qualia—the individual instances of conscious experience, such as the feeling of pain or the perception of colour. In the biological realm, consciousness is explored through the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), which are the specific brain states associated with conscious experience. The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) suggests that consciousness corresponds to the integrated information across the brain's neural network.

## Neural Networks — Biological vs Artificial  
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are designed to mimic the human brain's functionality, processing information in a manner akin to biological neural networks (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015). However, significant differences remain. Biological neural networks result from millions of years of evolution and dense biochemical processes. ANNs, while advanced, operate through algorithmic learning and lack the biological complexity that might contribute to consciousness.

### Types of Artificial Neural Networks:
 - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Primarily used for image and video recognition, CNNs consist of multiple layers that convolve with a filter to detect various features within the data
 - **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs):** These are the simplest type of neural network, composed of multiple layers of neurons in a fully connected manner, typically used for classification and regression tasks
 - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed to recognise patterns in data sequences, RNNs are used for tasks such as language modelling and time series prediction, with their architecture allowing information to persist

## Philosophical Debates on Machine Consciousness  

### Arguments for Machine Consciousness 
Advocates like Ray Kurzweil suggest that machines might achieve a level of complexity sufficient for consciousness as AI technology progresses. Functionalists argue that if a system performs the same functions as a conscious brain, it could be considered conscious.

### Arguments Against Machine Consciousness
Critics like John Searle argue that simulating human understanding is not equivalent to true understanding. Searle’s Chinese Room Argument posits that a machine can manipulate symbols without understanding their meaning, thereby lacking true consciousness. Hubert Dreyfus also criticises the notion of machine consciousness, emphasising the role of human-like physical action in conscious experience.

### Ethical Implications  
If machines could achieve consciousness, this raises great ethical questions. The moral status of conscious machines would necessitate reimagining their rights and treatment. Additionally, integrating conscious AI into society could challenge our notions of being a living being and individual rights, potentially leading to significant societal shifts.

## Conclusion  
The study of consciousness, whether in biological entities or artificial neural networks, spans a vast area, including but not limited to deep philosophical, scientific, and ethical issues. Understanding consciousness enhances our comprehension of the human mind and prepares us for the future implications of AI. As research progresses, the dialogue between philosophy, biology, and AI will remain crucial in navigating the complexities of consciousness in both natural and artificial realms.
